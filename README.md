**The Voice of the Cape — Early Church Records Transcribed and Preserved**

Vox Capensis is an open, long-term archival project dedicated to the **systematic transcription, translation, and preservation of early Cape church records**, with a primary focus on the 17th-century Dutch period at the Cape of Good Hope.

The name *Vox Capensis* (“Voice of the Cape”) reflects the aim of this project:  
to let original voices from the early Cape speak again — clearly, faithfully, and accessibly.

This repository functions as a **living source edition**, intended for genealogists, historians, and researchers, and explicitly welcomes collaboration with organisations such as **eGGSA**.

## Purpose

The goals of Vox Capensis are to:

- Preserve **primary-source church correspondence and registers** in durable plain text
- Provide **faithful transcriptions** of original 17th-century Dutch texts
- Provide **clear modern English translations**
- Maintain strict separation between **source, transcription, and translation**
- Enable **open collaboration** and peer verification
- Create a reliable foundation for future indexing, analysis, and publication

This is **not** a finite project. It is designed to grow over many years.

## Scope (initial)

Current focus includes:

- Church correspondence and reports from the **Cape of Good Hope (c. 1652–1664)**
- Records associated with **Pieter van der Stael**, sick-comforter
- Material spanning the administrations of **Jan van Riebeeck** and successors
- Baptisms, marriages, communions, attestations, poor relief, and church governance
- Ships, ministers, burghers, enslaved persons, and indigenous individuals as recorded in church contexts

The scope will expand as additional sources are added.

## Repository Structure

```text
/sources
  /scans            # Original document images (where available)
  /transcriptions   # Faithful transcriptions (original spelling retained)
  /translations     # Modern English translations
  /metadata         # Structured metadata (YAML/JSON)
/notes              # Research notes, commentary, and context
```

Each document exists in **multiple layers**.  
Original texts are never overwritten or “corrected”.

## Editorial Principles

- No silent corrections
- Original spelling, punctuation, and structure are preserved
- Damage, uncertainty, or ambiguity is explicitly marked  
  (e.g. `[illegible]`, `<sic>`, `<blank>`)
- Translations prioritise accuracy over stylistic polish
- Interpretation and commentary are clearly separated from source text

These principles are essential for scholarly and genealogical reliability.

---

## Collaboration

Vox Capensis is intentionally open and collaborative.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- Additional transcriptions
- Improved or alternative translations
- Source verification and cross-referencing
- Annotations and historical context
- Indexing of names, places, ships, and dates

Researchers affiliated with **eGGSA**, as well as independent contributors, are explicitly encouraged to participate.

---

## Why Plain Text?

All material is stored as **UTF-8 LF plain text / Markdown** to ensure:

- Long-term accessibility
- Transparent version control and clean diffs
- Full audit trails of changes
- Searchability and future computational analysis
- Freedom from proprietary formats
- Consistent use of **LF (Unix-style) line endings**, avoiding CRLF

This repository is intended to remain usable **decades into the future**.

---

## Long-Term Vision

Vox Capensis aims to become:

- A comprehensive corpus of early Cape church sources
- A trusted citation base for genealogical and academic work
- A collaborative bridge between private researchers and public heritage organisations
- A model for responsible, open historical source preservation
