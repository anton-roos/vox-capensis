# Vox Capensis

**The Voice of the Cape — Early Church Records Transcribed and Preserved**

Vox Capensis is an open, long-term archival project dedicated to the **systematic transcription, translation, and preservation of early Cape church records**, with a primary focus on the 17th-century Dutch period at the Cape of Good Hope.

The name *Vox Capensis* (“Voice of the Cape”) reflects the aim of this project:  
to let original voices from the early Cape speak again — clearly, faithfully, and accessibly.

This repository functions as a **living source edition**, intended for genealogists, historians, and researchers, and explicitly welcomes collaboration with organisations such as **eGGSA**.

## Purpose

The goals of Vox Capensis are to:

- Preserve **primary-source church correspondence and registers** in durable plain text
- Provide **faithful transcriptions** of original 17th-century Dutch texts
- Provide **clear modern English translations**
- Maintain strict separation between **source, transcription, and translation**
- Enable **open collaboration** and peer verification
- Create a reliable foundation for future indexing, analysis, and publication

This is **not** a finite project. It is designed to grow over many years.

## Scope (initial)

Current focus includes:

- Church correspondence and reports from the **Cape of Good Hope (c. 1652–1664)**
- Records associated with **Pieter van der Stael**, sick-comforter
- Material spanning the administrations of **Jan van Riebeeck** and successors
- Baptisms, marriages, communions, attestations, poor relief, and church governance
- Ships, ministers, burghers, enslaved persons, and indigenous individuals as recorded in church contexts

The scope will expand as additional sources are added.
